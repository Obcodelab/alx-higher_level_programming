-- The tv_genres table contains only one record where name = Comedy (but the id can be different)
-- Each record should display: tv_shows.title
-- Results must be sorted in ascending order by the show title
-- You can use only one SELECT statement
-- The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command
